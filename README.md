# loan-prediction-using-machine-learning-algorithms-in-R
#### I did this project in my initial days of the machine learning journey. In this project, I used different machine learning models to predict whether one should given a loan or not. I used Models like logistic Regression, decision tree, random forest, etc. and model evaluation metrics were AUC.
